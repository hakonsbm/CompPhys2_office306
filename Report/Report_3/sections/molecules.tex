\subsection{Variational Monte Carlo calculation for Hydrogen and Beryllium molecules}
	For the Hydrogen molecule we did VMC computations of both two different trialfunctions as described in \cref{sec:H2}. With adding together the hydrogenic wavefunctions we found a binding energy of \(-1.15828\) a.u., with \(\sigma^2_* = 0.000225\). For the trialfunction were the hydrogenic wavefunctions were subtracted the binding energy were positive and unrealistic, see \cref{tab:EnergyAlphaBetaReference} for values. For the second VMC calculation, which should be for two same spin electrons the nuclei distance, $\alpha$ and $\beta$ values used were probably not correct and we should have spent more time making sure that they were.

	In the computations of the Beryllium molecule there is some error in the code or procedure which causes faulty values, so the energy values are not to be trusted.
