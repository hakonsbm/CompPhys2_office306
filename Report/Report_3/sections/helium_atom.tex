\subsection{Variational Monte Carlo calculations of the helium atom}
		As a first attempt to solve the ground state energy for the helium
		atom we perform Variational Monte Carlo calculation with a brute force
		Metropolis sampling. We do this with two trial wave functions
		\[
		\psi_{T1}({\bf r_{1}},{\bf r_{2}},{\bf r_{12}})=\exp{\left(-\alpha(r_{1}+r_{2})\right)}
		\]
		and
		\[
		\psi_{T2}({\bf r_{1}},{\bf r_{2}},{\bf r_{12}})=\exp{\left(-\alpha(r_{1}+r_{2})\right)}\exp{\left(\frac{r_{12}}{2(1+\beta r_{12})}\right)},
		\]
		using $\alpha$ and $\beta$ as variational parameters. Energy values
		for the simple wave function, $\psi_{T1}$, using only one variational
		parameter $\alpha$, are shown in figure \ref{fig01:alpha_Simple}.
		We run the Variational Monte Carlo calculation with $10^{7}$ cycles.
		As we see in the figures, the energy minimum occurs when we use $\alpha=1.65$.
		Using this value for $\alpha$ we get an energy of $-2.8442934$.
		The parameter $\alpha$ can be interpreted as a parameter for the
		force pulling the electron to the nucleus.

	We now look at our second trial function, $\psi_{T2}$. Running over
	different values for the two variables $\alpha$ and $\beta$, again
	with $10^{7}$ cycles in the Monte Carlo simulation, we get the results
	presented in figure \ref{fig03:AlphaBeta}. From this run we find
	that the optimal values are $\alpha=1.8$ and $\beta=0.94$, and we
	get a minimum energy of $-2.8979105$, which is considerably better
	than without the Jastrow factor.

	Finally we use our Variational Monte Carlo machinery to find the ground
	state energy for a beryllium atom. Since beryllium has 4 electrons,
	compared to the 2 in helium, the computation is much slower and we
	only had time to run it for $10^{6}$ cycles. We then find the lowest
	energy to be $-14.4127$ with $\alpha=3.8$ and $\beta=0.293$.

	From reseach papers we find the value for energy in the ground state
	of helium to be $-2.9037$ \cite{Kinoshita:1957:PR} and the value
	for energy in the ground state of beryllium to be $-14.667$ \cite{Koput:2011:PCCP}.

	obtained with our Variational Monte Carlo method with results from
	various research papers.

			    Helium $\psi_{T1}$ & 1.65 & -
			    \\ \hline
			    Helium $\psi_{T2}$ & 1.8 & 0.94

			    Beryllium $\psi_{T2}$	& 3.8	&	 0.293

	  		\caption{The values for \(\alpha\) and \( \beta \) where found by doing running Monte Carlo calculation with over a mesh of different \(\alpha\) and \( \beta \) values, with stepssize \(0.02\). Each Monte Carlo run went over \(10 000 	000\), using importance sampling. Then the run with the lowest energy gave the \(\alpha\) and \(\beta\) values.}
		  	\label{tab:alpha_beta1}
		\end{table}

		Table \ref{tab:alpha_beta1} shows the values, for \(\alpha\) and \(\beta\) values, we got from  running several Monte Carlo cycles with different values. As an algorithm to pick out the best values we minimized the energy found in the Monte Carlo runs. The values found are quite uncertain since the variance of the energy was quite high compared to the difference caused by varying the parameters. The variance was more smooth as a function of the parameters, see fig \ref{fig03:AlphaBeta} and should have been used.




			\subsubsection{Computational speed gain by using an analytical local energy}
				By using an analytical expression for the local energy instead of using a numerical derivation in the calculation a speed up of approximately factor \(4\) was achieved, see table \ref{tab:analyticVSNumeric}.
