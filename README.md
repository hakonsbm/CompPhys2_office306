Hi, I saw was adding importance sampling stuff now, so then I will stay away from it for now :)

Temporary result from run of the trial functions

With trialfunction HeliumSimpleAnalytical
alpha =  1.7 , beta =  0.0  and the lowest energy was :  -2.8451959
With trialfunction HeliumSimpleNumerical
alpha =  1.7 , beta =  0.0  and the lowest energy was :  -2.8451939
With trialfunction HeliumJastrowAnalytical
alpha =  1.8 , beta =  1.05  and the lowest energy was :  -2.8968802
With trialfunction HeliumJastrowNumerical


###############################333
Adding some more trialfunctions done, probably error in the analytical expression for the trial function with the Jastrow Cooefficient. Next we should probably clean up the runMonteCarlo() so it only runs a monte carlo, and all of the other stuff is done somwhere else

I'll add classes for the analytical solution to trial function 1 and 2, and a numerical for trial function 2 today :)

Added sepparate project and vmc files for importance sampling.
